```{r}
#| label: setup
library(reportabs)
labour_force <- read_absdata("labour_force")
```

`abs_plot()` will do most of the heavy lifting for you, if you know the indicator you want to plot. If not, typing plot_ and pressing tab will show the included plots. `abs_plot(labour_force, indicator = "Employed total", type = "labour_force")` is identical to `plot_employed_total("Australia")`.

```{r}
#| label: abs-plot-example
#| fig-width: 6
#| fig-asp: 0.618
#| out-width: 70%
abs_plot(labour_force, filter_with = list(indicator = "Employed total", state = "Australia"), type = "labour_force")

```
